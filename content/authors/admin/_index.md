I am a Ph.D. student in the University of California, San Diego's Psychology Department. Before my graduate studies I worked with Dr. Roland Griffiths at the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic & Consciousness Research. Here at UCSD, I am a member of the [Psychedelics and Health Research Initiative](https://phri.ucsd.edu). Psychedelics continue to show promise as a novel therapeutic option for a variety of clinical indications. My work asks: **<u>How?</u>**

I am particularly interested in the role of cognitive flexibility and using cognitive development as a model to bridge the levels of analysis in psychedelic science.

<!--My dissertation work aims to characterize the cognitive mechanisms underlying psychedelic therapy.-->

I am also passionate about pedagogy and enhancing the educational experience for all students, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds. I love creating and redesigning course materials to help students learn more creatively and develop a passion for research and data science.
